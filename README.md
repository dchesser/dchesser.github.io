## Inclusions

Because this is hosted on GitHub Pages, I've taken some liberties in a
few ways to bypass safe mode and the inability to create my own blocks.
Not pretty but they'll do.

### Tangents

Tangents are a [soliloquy][wikt:soliloquy] in which something is
definitely unrelated to the topic on hand.
As to not go too far from the subject, they should be used sparingly.

#### Parameters:

* `header`: Optional.
  Precedes the content itself as a header.
  If nil, the title will be "Tangent:".

* `mood`: Optional.
  Used to flair up the tangent with a self-portrait of me in whatever mood it is.
  Most of the time this should be `thinking`. ðŸ¤”

* `content`: Required.
  The content of a tangent is still Markdown.
  Quotes will need to be properly escaped with `\"`.
