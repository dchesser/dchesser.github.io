If you're here, you've likely been directed by me to read these terms
and agree to them before rolling up your first character at my table.
These are by no means exhaustive and can and will be updated as more
violations of common sense occur.
With every rule and law comes a tale of its own to justify it.

1. <span id="rule-1">Thou shalt not bringeth thine metal dice.</span>

   Not only are they a potential hazard to scratch a table, but I also
   lost a pair of shoes to them after finding out the four-sided dice
   are nicknamed "caltrops" for a _reason_.
   I like my shoes to at _least_ be water-resistant, thank you very much.

2. <span id="rule-2">No More Than 10 Shades of Grey Per Session.</span>

   Do not try to seduce the ancient fortune teller because you think
   "that cougar could go for a kitten".
   Likewise, I shall not stick around a <abbr title="Game-master">GM</abbr>
   that _allows_ this to happen and to describe the scenario at hand
   while the rest of us wait outside the wagon instead of simply
   fading to black for a commercial break or skipping the scene.
   
3. <span id="rule-3">Hygiene is Not Optional.</span>

   Showering and de-oderant is mandatory.

4. <span id="rule-4">Thou Shalt Not Molest ~~Minors~~, Period.</span>

   I don't care if they're fictional! Or if they're even your tablemates!
   I can **not** believe this has to be written down as a manner and
   yet here we are.
