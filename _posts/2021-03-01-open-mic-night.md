Another month another <i>Open Mic Night</i> am I a great ape
creature or what?

As a technologist, I was hoping to be writing more about technologies
I discover and use and unique ways to use them rather than a sequence
of <i>Open Mic Nights</i>.
Technologies like that attempt at creating my own static site
generator using [Makefiles] and the [M4] text preprocessor.
That was years ago in my early college days when I was playing around
with such relatively useless ideas instead of homework.
Now with that creative swamp drained by Web framework [magic](http://catb.org/jargon/html/M/magic.html)
and that programmer "matured" (from a certain point of view),
what *do* I have the energy to tinker with after the daily coding
and architecting?

During breaks and downtime, I've finally been getting my creative
juices flowing during my solitaire gaming.
Enough that I could probably throw up a few booklets to publish.
I just found out Kickstarter runs the [Zine Quest] event through
February where RPG zines become more prominent there.
Maybe some time I'll make my debut.
I've gotten pretty fond of [ConTeXt] for my typesetting.
If you wanted an easier TeX system and the power of Lua scripting,
this is your call.

Already had a couple of friends and acquaintances looking to get into
table-top RPGs, so now I'm going to need to prepare a few hexagons to
send them to their grave in.
