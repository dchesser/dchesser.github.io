Not much happened besides the lousy Smarch weather.

I did take a look into the [Rust programming language][Rust] earlier this
month to see what the hubbub was about.
Giving it a spin, I went on to solve [day 2 of 2015's Advent of Code][Aoc15d2],
which lacked a star thus far.
[My solution][Solution] was a "simple" one: parse each line,
create a `Present` data structure,
tack on a few methods, and tally up the sum.
Most of the time here involved fighting the compiler regarding type
mismatches with unwrapping and the [`Into` trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.Into.html).
Even if it is supposed to be safer and more efficient, I don't
consider Rust to be my main language despite awakening the Rust
Evangelism Strikeforce after complaining.
My domain is more in the problem at hand as opposed to needing to
worry about the efficiency or speed, so even a basic garbage-collected
language is good enough for me.
In other words, not low-level stuff.
Maybe some day later.
I'll stick with my [Crystal] thank you very much.

Tangentially related, it's that time of year again where it gets
unbearably hot with no reprieve.
In other words, it's about that time for my yearly tradition of
playing through a game from my childhood: Super Mario Sunshine.
That's not really helping me feel young when that game is almost
20 years old.
Why that game? It's an odd tradition I started back in high school
over the summer break.
A tropical theme ought to fit with the summer, so why not?
This time, I swear to complete it 100%, all shines and blue coins.
Maybe do a walkthrough of it so I can break out of this tradition.

Now to find my memory card. ðŸ¤”
