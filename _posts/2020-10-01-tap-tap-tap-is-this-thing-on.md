Not sure if it's a change in the season or something but it feels like
a new chapter is opening up.
Been going through a rough spot and lost all my friends so I got all
the time in the world to figure out what I should be doing.
Now this begs the question...
What _should_ I be doing?
This could be a chance to start all over again!

Pop a <abbr title="compact disc">CD</abbr> into the stereo, put on a
kettle, and make a Web site doubling as a tech blog and personal diary
as I get better and get a grip?
May as well.

Anyway, the name's Dave.
This time not a pseudonym since fake names don't get hired without
making the connection between the truth and the lie.
Defeats the point of a fake persona.
I command computers to do my employers' bidding for a living.
When I'm tired from that at the end of the day, instead I shoot
twenty-sided dice or just doodle something inane.
You'll see both pop up here every now and then.

From now it's going to be about me grabbing this chance to be a better
man than I was one year ago, last week, a couple of months ago, three
years ago, *five minutes ago*.
As the voice on the stereo just said:

> If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by<br>
> You're thinking like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die.<br>
> Out there is a fortune waiting to be had<br>
> If you think I'd let it go, you're mad<br>
> You got another thing comin'.
