The Futureâ„¢ is Now.â“‡
Like what many other folks do, this is a good time to reflect on what
you want to accomplish by being reminded of the fleeting
one-second-per-second speed of time.
Putting off a change in your lifestyle for a date to roll over means
that you might just put it off later and later.
**Just do it!**
I can claim to be more original and start now by being in a rut that
finally came to a breaking point in late November.
Would've gotten an <i>Open Mic Night</i> out for December, wrapping up
the awful phenomenon known as 2020, going down in history as a cursed
number, if it weren't for the breakdowns and such.

Tonight's <i>Open Mic Night</i> is about getting out of this rut.
Instead of panicking about it,
[put on something soothing](https://sport3000.bandcamp.com/album/--8)
and calm down.
**I SAID CALM DOWN!!**

# Routine

Ever since the initial (and short) "quarantine lockdown" back in 2020,
folk have been saying to keep in a routine to keep your sanity as you work
remotely.
Having a routine is not the only important thing, but having a *productive*
routine does wonders for that good feeling of getting something useful done.
It's easy to get up in the morning and dig up fossils and pull
pumpkins to pay off your imaginary island mortgage to a raccoon dog
while your pot of coffee is brewing before the daily stand-up meeting.

Getting let go via SARS-CoV-2-related [restructuring] at the company
was, perhaps, the second step in a downward spiral following the stress
from the layoffs earlier in the year.
Been taking that time since to get my mental health in order while hunting
down a new job.

Work on skills, become a better person, therapy, see a psychiatrist...
You know, things that would help with depression.

Games can wait until the evening.
That loan doesn't have a due date;
bitey's not going to touch my spaghetti if I'm not playing;
demons aren't invading if I'm not looking.
Early mornings now involve some kettlebell exercises,
[a quick lesson in another language][1], and a bowl of instant grits
along with the coffee.
The rest of the day involves brushing up on a [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
project to learn the framework *properly*.

Another thing that would help is to get a task done and out of the way
now so you don't run out of options some time later.
Slather a small amount of honey mustard or Chick-Fil-A sauce with some
hot sauce on a tortilla, slave over a hot stove preparing some eggs,
and throw it in the wrap with some deli meat, cheese, and salad mixture.
Bam!
Put those wraps in a bag along with some [crisps][pringles] and cheese
sticks and you've got lunches for the whole week.
Spend that hour on the weekend cooking ahead of time instead of
waiting until the last minute and wonder which frozen meal you're
going to heat up in the microwave oven.

# Organization

I have done absolutely none of this "organizing" stuff that's all the
rave since the dawn of time.
Compiling what notes I got, jotting down my contacts into an address-book,
and journaling my days should've been done like a million years ago.
Smells like a good time to start doing that.

It's common for other [Emacs] users to use [Org Mode] to handle this
part of their lives.
Optionally with drinking the [zettelkasten] fruit punch.
Doing that doesn't feel right.
Like doing anything digital, it's prone to distractions where you end
up forgetting what you were off to do in the first place.
If I type something in, it'll just get lost in the catacombs of my [home folder][~]
where not even Sherlock Holmes can deduce its location.
Instead, I go physical.

I recently got a [notebook cover](https://www.jetpens.com/Kokuyo-Systemic-Cover-Notebook-Ring-Type-Synthetic-Leather-A5-6-mm-Rule-Black/pd/24807),
a planner, and some refillable notebooks to start keeping a [bullet journal][bujo]
and take notes down without prejudice.
Keeping track of my daily routine, progress towards goals, and all
that jazz doesn't escape my notice in this little black book.

Perhaps I ought to get a whiteboard and some magnets to keep a [kanban board]
of upcoming tasks. ðŸ¤”

All in all, if you're in a downward spiral, seeking help is the first
best thing you can do to save yourself.
Introspection, figuring out what you need to do, and then acting upon
it is the second best.
