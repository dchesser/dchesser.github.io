[I *did* say][1] that I was going to start treating this site as my version
of shouting into the void: specifically a journal chronicling a way to
overcome whatever it is that's plaguing me.
Most people just micro-blog on Twitter or Mastodon instead.
Not doing this there;
both of them are intolerable hell-holes in the own different ways.
Thus, welcome to Open Mic Night and oh would you look at that I'm up
on the stage.
I'mma let you finish, but right now it's my time to shine.

So how's this for a first skit: airplane food.
What's up with that?
How do you justify feeding airplanes that stuff?
Now that's out of the way, on to our next course: the slice of life.

"Welp. That's the last one.", I said back in 2017, rummaging through a
pencil box, grabbing the last nib for my drawing tablet's stylus.
A few years have passed and now it's ground down to a stump.
Tonight's topic is about art.
My old drawing tablet's about at the point where it needs to be retired.
The surface is already cracked and once this last nib becomes totally
unusable from running over that crack, that's it: I won't be able to
draw with it anymore.

It's an old Medion MD 85637 or at least that's what the label on the
bottom says.
Being my rusty trusty, it's seen me through most of my days in high
school, college, and a few years afterward in true school-free adult-hood.

Half the reason I even stuck with it this long is that it
[has GNU/Linux support](https://digimend.github.io/tablets/Waltop_Slim_Tablet_12.1_inch/)
which I found out accidentally by forgetting to "install the driver"
after my switch to Ubuntu at the time.
Looking at the "Sold as" list, I can tell it gets rebranded
enough that if I really want a new one, I could grab it under the
Adesso label at Micro Center.
This version, though, was a $50 snag at Aldi as a Christmas gift I was
in high school a decade ago when I decided to get more serious with
doing digital art outside of the curve tool on some MS Paint clone to
make prettier lines.

There have been times where I thought it gave up the ghost and I
experimented with a Wacom Bamboo for a short while.
Garbage.  Yeah I said it.
That "short while" was a few months until the stylus stopped working.
The nib had to be replaced _monthly_ instead of every few years too.
Maybe their better tablets don't suffer from being low quality but I
would suggest almost anything else that isn't Wacom after this experience.

Now I'm looking to hopefully branch out and transfer my artsy talents
from cyberspace to meatspace.
It's been fun in the various softwares that did the job between
[MyPaint] and [Krita].
They're where I honed my extracurricular craft and even
earned some disposable income on commissions of varying quality and
content (but hey fifty bucks is fifty bucks).
I'll still keep Krita around for touching up after scanning the stuff.

I will miss being able to undo after every stroke though.
Much cheaper than erasing something to the point of tearing the paper.

To prepare for the inevitable, I ordered some elaborate "writing
implements" a bit ago to tinker with.
Snagged a small pack of [Tombow Fudenosuke][Fudenosuke] brush pens
where one of them is "firm"
(<ruby>„Åó„Å£„Åã„Çä<rp>(</rp><rt>Shikkari</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>)
and two are soft or "quick?"
(<ruby>„ÅØ„ÇÑ„Åã<rp>(</rp><rt>Hayaka</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>)
and one of those "quick" brushes has an end with grey ink.
I neither understand a lick of Japanese nor enjoy its media like a lot
of other nerds do so I'm not even sure if those are accurate translations.
Maybe I should add this language to my repertoire... ü§î

Playing around with them was... odd.
Like that was the most fun I had in months or maybe even years.
A whole new wave of possibilties opened up where I can use a
pressure-sensitive brush but on paper instead of an electronic pad and
emphasize *things* that were not meant or able to be emphasized before!
For starters, I can use a lighter color to shade instead of
half-assing it with hatching or whatever I would do with a pencil.
Maybe a nib holder would open up some more options.
If I could stand writing something coherent I would totally look into
doing a Web comic like people keep telling me to do.

Now if only we didn't have this false dichotomy where people believe
you can only be good at drawing *or* programming but *not both*.
