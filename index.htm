<h1><code>under_construction.gif</code></h1>

<p>
  A wireframe model of a sub-urban home, rendered from the foundation.<br>
  Freshly-doped silicon motherboards on a saw-horse, cut down to kilobyte-sized pieces.<br>
  Neighborhood ne'er-do-wells hover-surf down the sidewalk on
  their distended keyboards, customized
  in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout">Dvorak</a>
  just to get a rise.
</p>

<p>
  A moving van finally arrived after taking
  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.2.1">exit 200</a>
  off of the information superhighway.<br>
  In the driver's seat, a fresh Web-master looks on in pride at his future endeavor.<br>
  At last, a home for him and his thinking engines adorned in cheap black plastic.
</p>

<p>
  But first, dibs must be claimed, for the early bird catches
  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm">worm</a>.<br>
  Then the address must be given a name, which the Web-master decrees
  "<a href="https://dchesser.website">dchesser dot website"</a>.<br>
  Then the address must be given an actual place, probably
  somewhere on the Web-master's <a href="https://github.com/dchesser">GitHub account</a>.
</p>

<p>
  There will be plenty of time to unpack the gratuitous palm trees
  and pastel neon lamps once this home is rendered.
