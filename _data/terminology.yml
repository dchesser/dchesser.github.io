      forum, or other resource that can be abstracted as if it were a

      It does not have anything to do with the practice of
      [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics).

- jargon: &final-voiced-e
    term: "Ë"
    definition: |
      Perhaps a thing specific to me, but this is a final E with a
      [diaeresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaeresis_(diacritic)#English).
      This indicates the pronunciation of the final syllable does not
      end in a consonant but with the /ɛ~e/ vowel.
      In this, I adapt loan-words such as "sakë" (rice wine) and
      "resumë" (a piece of paper that you apply for jobs with).

      I stand by the idea that contrary to popular belief, we do have
      quite a few rules in English orthography and the silent final E
      is one such rule that affects pronunciation.
      Otherwise it becomes "sake" (for goodness's sake) or "resume" (to continue).
      It is not an [umlaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_umlaut)
      as a different letter since this is an orthographical mark.
      If you are going to make jokes about reading <i>The New
      Yorker</i>, you won't have been the first.
